After making mockups which I loved, it turned out there were lots of redundant parts in it. At a certain point I was pushing everything to make them acceptable, but in the end I decided to go back to the drawingboard with a mindset of 'less is more'.

So, setting the viewport to mobile I started designing again which went a lot smoother.


!!Logo placing is different for wider viewports

using color picker (chrome extension tool) for red navbar fontcolor, same as logo. To stand out.



The font size for the nav bar is dependent on the viewport width for scaling purposes, however, as with the logo it messes up when the viewport gets relatively wide, at the same breakpoint of 1:1. So I added a media query for wide viewports and also the 1:1 aspect ratio.

With some of the better do's and don't in mind I started on a clean landing 
page with no unnecessary clutter.
Also I wanted a background that was suitable and the same for all viewports, so I had to make the seperate log (the guitar), jump to another part of the background so it wouldn't cover the bandmembers. Also specific centering was required to have all bandmembers in view.

The info page with the descriptions of the bandmembers I tried to make it as clean as possible, so I put the pictures down with a toggle button and for the touchscreen users a visual confirmation  that the button had been pressed. For larger viewscreens I made the text appear right away on a  convenient layout. Also for larger viewscreens I added a hover effect over the navigation elements and the social links.

After making mockups which I loved, it turned out there were lots of redundant
parts in it. At a certain point I was pushing everything to make
them acceptable, but in the end I decided to go back to the drawingboard with
a mindset of 'less is more'.

So, setting the viewport on mobile I started designing again which went a lot
smoother.

Since I was working on the project while bootstrap was pushed to version 4, I
decided to stick with 3 for this project. Of course I am updating to 4 after
that.
edit: I did switch to version 4. The navbar functionality was expanded in
version 4 which I used.

!!Logo placing is different for wider viewports

using color picker (chrome extension tool) for red navbar fontcolor, same as logo. To stand out.

The font size for the nav bar is dependent on the viewport width for scaling
purposes, however, as with the logo it messes up when the viewport gets 
relatively wide, at the same breakpoint of 1:1. So I added a media query for
wide viewports and also the 1:1 aspect ratio,.
